<p >
Methodist is one who has ‘the love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost given unto him’;
 one who ‘loves the Lord his God with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his mind, and with all his strength.’
  God is the joy of his heart, and the desire of his soul; which is constantly crying out, ‘Whom have I in Heaven but thee?.
   These are the principles and practices of our sect; these are the marks of a true Methodist.
    By these alone do those who are in derision so called, desire to be distinguished from other men. 
    If any man say: ‘Why, these are only the common, fundamental principles of Christianity!’ thou hast said; so I mean;
     this is the very truth; I know they are no other; and I would to God both thou and all men knew, that I, and all who follow my judgment,
      do vehemently refuse to be distinguished from other men, by any but the common principles of Christianity – the plain,
       old Christianity that I teach, renouncing and detesting all other marks of distinction.
</p>
<br>
<h2 >METHODISM AND THE BIBLE</h2>
<p >
The Methodist doctrinal standards identify as a canonical thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. 
</p>
<p > It also affirms the Bible as the source of all that is “necessary” and “sufficient” unto salvation and “is to be received through the Holy Spirit as the true rule and guide for faith and practice”. 
    Methodists share with other Christians the conviction that Scripture is the primary source and criterion for Christian doctrine. Through Scripture the Living Christ meets us in the experience of redeeming grace.
    The people called Methodists are convinced that Jesus Christ is the Living Word of God in our midst whom we trust in life and death.The biblical authors,illumined by the Holy Spirit,bear witness that in Christ the world is reconciled to God.
    We also believe that the Bible bears authentic testimony to God’s self-disclosure in the life,death,and resurrection of Jesus Christ as well as in God’s work of creation,in the pilgrimage of Israel,and in the Holy Spirit’s ongoing activity 
    in Human beings inspired by the Holy Spirit,faith is born and nourished, our understanding is deepened,and the possibilities for transforming the world became apparent to us.</p>

<h2 >BEGINING OF METHODISM IN GHANA</h2>
<p >
The Methodist Church Ghana came into existence as a result of the missionary activities of the Wesleyan Methodist Church which was inaugurated with the arrival of the Rev’d Joseph Rhodes Dunwell in January, 1835, in the Gold Coast (Ghana). Like the mother Church, the Methodist Church in Ghana was established from a core of persons with Anglican background. Missionaries, notably Roman Catholics and Anglicans had come to the Gold Coast from the 15th Century. Their activities did not see much success. What was left was a school established in Cape Coast by the Anglicans during the time of Rev’d Philip Quaque, a Ghanaian priest. Those who came out of this school had scriptural knowledge. They also had scriptural materials which were supplied by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. It was not surprising that one of the local Bible study groups was known by this name in addition to other names.

It was a member of one of such Bible study groups, William De-Graft, who requested for Bibles through one Captain Potter of the ship called ‘Congo’. Through Captain Potter’s instrumentality, not only were Bibles sent, but also a Methodist missionary. In the first eight years of the Church’s life, 11 out of 21 Missionaries who worked in the Gold Coast died. Thomas Birch Freeman, who arrived at the Gold Coast in 1838 was a great pioneer of Missionary expansion. Between 1838 and 1857 he carried Methodism from the Coastal areas to Kumasi in the Asante hinterland of the Gold Coast. He also established Methodist Societies in Badagry and AbeoKuta in Nigeria with the assistance of William De-Graft. By 1854, the Church had been organized into circuits constituting a District with Rev’d T.B. Freeman as Chairman. However, Rev’d Freeman was replaced in 1856 by Rev’d William West. On 6th February, 1878, Synod took steps that were confirmed at the British Conference in July, 1878, that the District should be divided into two for effective ministries. The District had then extended to include areas in the then Gold Coast and Nigeria. The two districts were:
<ul >
<li >Gold Coast (Ghana) District, with Rev’d T.R. Picot as Chairman.</li>
<li>Yoruba and Popo, District with Rev’d John Milum as Chairman.</li>
</ul>
<p >Methodist evangelization of Northern Ghana began in 1910. After a long period of conflict with the Colonial Government, Missionary work was finally established in 1955, with Rev. Paul Adu as the first indigenous missionary of Northern Ghana.

In July 1961, the Methodist Church in Ghana became autonomous, and was called the Methodist Church Ghana, based on a Deed of Foundation. This deed of Foundation is enshrined in the Constitution and Standing Orders of our Church.

Currently, the Methodist Church Ghana, is one of the leading Churches in our country, with a total membership of over 600,000. The Church has 17 dioceses, 3,814 societies, 1,066 pastors, 15,920 local preachers, 24,100 Lay Leaders, many schools, an orphanage, hospitals and clinics.

<br>
<h2 >THE METHODIST EMBLEM</h2>
<p >This flag is being raised to remind us of the fact that even though we share in the
 ecumenical body, We are first and foremost Christians of the great Methodist Tradition. We are proud to have come
  to faith in Jesus Christ by the Gospel preached, taught, and practiced by the people called Methodists. 
  A society raised by the power of God to spread Scriptural holiness throughout the land. It is therefore important 
  that every Methodist within Diocese, Circuit and Society in the Connexion owns it and raises at the offices and chapels.

<h2 >THE GOLD BACKGROUND</h2>
<p >The Gold background symbolizes the richness of our heritage in the glorious hope of Jesus Christ.
 It also brings to mind that the Methodist Heritage handed over to us by our forebears is pure, dependable and worthwhile,
  and that a strict adherence will enable the Methodist to seeking faith to cultivate a personal and living faith which leads
   to salvation in Jesus Christ. Again, it remind us that, as we hoist the flag, embossed with the Ghana Methodist emblem, we 
   anticipate the day we would be welcomed to take our place in the city of Gold, the kingdom of God where Christ the Lord reigns 
   supreme

 <h2  >THE MAP OF GHANA WITH THE “NYAME DUA”</h2>
<p >This is a map of Ghana with the “Nyame Dua” (God’s Tree) symbol in the middle of the and embossed with a cross.
 The cross stretches from the ocean over the upper part of the map and also, goes beyond the East and West boarders.
  The vertical base of the cross stretches into the ocean because Methodism came to us through the sea, that is from England,
   and by ship which brought Rev. Joseph R. Dunwell. In Ghana, we went beyond the borders to share our faith.

The “Nyame Dua” symbols remind us that before the advent of a the missionaries, the concept of God was already known. 
The missionaries came to help us to name the name of Christ. We have the Ghana map in blue indicating our anticipating of making,
 the whole of Ghana Nation which has Christ as her Lord.
